# PIC16F84A-Voltmeter

Code to be compiled with the MPLab compiler to run on a PIC16F84A to act as a voltmeter, using an SPI ADC and LCD.

The LCD and ADC files were created by the lecturer, but modified by me to add functionality and imporve code quality. 
Created along with the circuit in Proteus as a university project, which was completed in pairs.
